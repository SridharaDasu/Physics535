! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run. 
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive  -  but spellings-sensitive!
! The changes here are illustrative, not always physics-motivated.

! 1) Settings that could be used in a main program, if desired.
Main:numberOfEvents = 100          ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 10000      ! abort run after this many flawed events

! 2) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 2212                   ! first beam, proton = 2212
Beams:idB = 2212                   ! second beam, proton = 2212
Beams:eCM = 100000.                ! CM energy of collision = 100 TeV

! 3) Settings for process generation internal to Pythia8.
!    Produce the Drell-Yan Process, including gamma/Z interference.
WeakSingleBoson:ffbar2gmZ = on

! 4) Optionally switch on hand-set cross section and Coulomb term.
! Note: these values are illustrative only, not to be taken seriously.

! 5) Switch off some key components of the simulation, for comparisons.
#PartonLevel:all = off              ! stop after hard process 

! 6) Make Z decay only to muons

23:onMode = 0       ! Z (23) decays to muons (13) only
23:onIfAny = 13

! 7) Parton distribution function selection

PDF:pHardSet = 8   ! Select CTEQ6L1, LO (used by CMS)
