Setup of Exercise04 is similar to Exercise03
Please follow the prior instructions for that.

The files you use are the same as those in Exercise03.  I recommend
you reuse the EventAnalysis.cc that you made for Exercise03 here.

The vlhc-j.cards and vlhc-z.cards are setup to simulate proton-proton
collisions at 100 TeV.  Notice that the program runs lot slower than
the e+-e- case.  There are many more final state particles.  Notice
that I had to setup a parton distribution function for this case as
protons are not fundamental fermions.  The vlhc-j cards file choses
QCD interactions with a minimum PT of 50 GeV.  These events have jets.
The jets are available in EventData.h.

To Do:

1) Copy, build and run the program to obtain vlhc-j.root and vlhc-z.root files
2) Examine the root file (following Exercise02) and check that RecoPhotonET
   is properly displayed.  Notice how different it is from Exercise03
3) Modify EventAnalysis.cc to find highest energy positively and negatively
   charged muons (make TLorentzVectors of those), then add them and make the 
   invariant mass of the combination using the existing method of the 
   TLorentzVector class.  {PMuMu = PMuPlus+PMuMinus;  invMass = PMuMu.M();}
4) Notice that the plot has a peak at MZ = 91 GeV and a tail which runs
   significantly higher.
5) Save the mu+mu- invariant mass plot to the file invMass.png 
6) Make plots of PT of the highest, second, third and fourth highest PT
   jets.  Although Pythia simulates 2-to-2 processes, there are several
   jets in each event.  Why?
7) Use hfac-h.cards file (from Exercise03) and see the invariant mass 
   distribution of the  highest two PT jets.  Is there a structure, 
   where you see a peak?   What is that particle?
8) Is it possible to see a peak in the dijet distribution for the 
   vlhc case for the same particle?
