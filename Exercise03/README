Setup of Exercise03 is similar to Exercise01 and Exercise02.
Please follow the prior instructions for that.

Notice that in Exercise03 there are new files UltraFastSim.[cc,h] & EventData.h
These files take the particles reconstructible by a detector such as CMS
and smear their momenta and energy such that detector effects are simulated.
The "reconstructed", aka smeared, particles are available from the UltraFastSim
class.  An example histogram for RecoPhotonET is added to the EventAnalysis.cc

To Do:

1) Copy, build and run the program to obtain hfac-h.root file
2) Examine the root file (following Exercise02) and check that RecoPhotonET
   is properly displayed.
3) Modify EventAnalysis.cc to find highest energy positively and negatively
   charged muons (make TLorentzVectors of those), then add them and make the 
   invariant mass of the combination using the existing method of the 
   TLorentzVector class.  {PMuMu = PMuPlus+PMuMinus;  invMass = PMuMu.M();}
4) Notice that the plot has a peak at MZ = 91 GeV
5) There may not be enough events. I suggest enhancing the peak by requiring
   that the Z boson decays only to mu+-mu-.  You need to place in the
   hfac-h.cards the appropriate commands:

   23:onMode = 0       ! Z (23) decays to muons (13) only
   23:onIfAny = 13

6) Save the mu+mu- invariant mass plot to the file invMass.png

7) Change the mass of the higgs to MH = 125 GeV

   25:m0 = 125

   This is just for fun.  If you have time, go change the production 
   mechanism to Higgs production and make Higgs to diphoton spectrum.
   Note that you will have to force the Higgs to decay to two photons.
