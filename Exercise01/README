Every time you login, you need to do the following to restore your environment:

cd ~/Physics535
source environment.sh
cd Exercise02

To build the program type:

make

Running generateData on hfac-e-250-z.cards to produce hfac-e-250-z.output file:

./generateData hfac-e-250-z.cards > hfac-e-250-z.output

Looking at your data:

Use Applications/System Tools/File Browser to open a file browser.
You should be able to double click or control-click and chose
applications.  Emacs and Kate are suitable ASCII file editor/browsers.

Web browser is also available, but you should probably run it natively
on your laptop for speed.

Please use the "Process Selection" on the left to try out various possibilities allowed.

Relevant Standard Model processes are Electroweak, Top and Higgs if you setup an 
electron-positron or muon collider, as these leptons do not have color interactions.

There are also several Beyond the Standard Model processes available to play with.


Core Unix concepts and command line programs that you need:

Your interaction with the unix computer is through your terminal (putty) window.

When you login, the computer sets your working directory to be the folder in
the computer's file system with your files.  To check your current working
directory you can use the command:

pwd

You can change your working directory using the command:

cd <directory>

You can double check the effect of that command by using pwd 

You can always travers up and down the filesystem hierarchy using the two "directories"
 . and ..

The character . stands for current directory

The characters .. stand for the directory just below.  See example below:

-bash-3.2$ pwd
/afs/hep.wisc.edu/home/dasu/Physics535/Exercise01
-bash-3.2$ cd ..
-bash-3.2$ pwd
/afs/hep.wisc.edu/home/dasu/Physics535
-bash-3.2$ cd Exercise01
-bash-3.2$ pwd
/afs/hep.wisc.edu/home/dasu/Physics535/Exercise01
-bash-3.2$ 

The key strokes that you type are interpreted by what is called shell.

The commands that you type are executed when you type <return> key.

The shell executes the command (or program) in the environment 
(printenv to see your environment variables)

The programs can read and write to that window.

In addition you can redirect the output to/from the commands.  

The command 
./generateData hfac-e-250-z.cards

Runs the program generateData which is located in current directory
as indicated by .  This program is written to take the name of the
file with the Pythia configuration information from the command line.
That is the reason for putting the name of the higgs-z.cards there.
By putting some other file you can change the cards read by generateData

You can redirect the long output from generateData to a different
file so that you can browse it at leisure.  To do that you use the command:

./generateData hfac-e-250-z.cards > hfac-e-250-z.output

Copying files:

cp <fileName> <newFileName>

Removing files and empty directories:

rm <file>
rmdir <directory>

Moving files around or renaming them:

mv <file> <newFileName>

In above <file> and <newFileName> can include directory

If you need help, please feel free to email me.  You can also find many unix
and programming tutorials online.  Don't stall -- just try things out is the
best advise that I can offer.
