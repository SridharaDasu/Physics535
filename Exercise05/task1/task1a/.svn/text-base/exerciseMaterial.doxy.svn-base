 \mainpage Task 1.a Geant4 Materials

\section t1as1 OBJECTIVE

Learn how to create and use a material.
This Geant4 example contains the description of a typical detector composed by a set of three silicon microstrip detectors and a final electromagnetic calorimeter. The silicon planes act as a tracker giving the possibility to determine the particle track and vertex. The calorimeter measures the final particle energy.

\section t1as2 HOW

In this exercise you will be asked to create the material used for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the exercise: 
PbWO4 (lead tungstate).

The relevant method to look at is in DetectorConstruction::DefineMaterials()

Look at the code there in file src/DetectorConstruction.cc you will notice that the G4Material* pointer called pbwo4 is not instantiated.
  
The line 
\verbatim
G4cout<<*(G4Material::GetMaterialTable()) << G4endl;
\endverbatim

added at the end of the functions prints the list of known materials.

\section t1as3a PRACTICE

Download from the following web site the tarball with the exercises:
\verbatim
http://geant4.lngs.infn.it/courseBelfast2013/code/task1.tar
\endverbatim

Copy it in your 'geant4-exercises' working directory, unpack it:
\verbatim
        % cd geant4-exercises
	% tar -xf task1.tar    
\endverbatim


Inside the geant4-exercises directory you can create a sub-directory named "task1a-build":

\verbatim
% mkdir task1a-build
\endverbatim

Enters into the newly created folder:

\verbatim
% cd task1a-build
\endverbatim
and run the command cmake:
\verbatim
% cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/usr/local/geant4.9.6/geant4.9.6-install/lib/Geant4-9.6.0 [task1a_directory]
\endverbatim

To compile, simply execute "make" in the build directory:
\verbatim
% make
\endverbatim
The build will now run, and will output information on the progress of the build and current operations.
This will create an executable file "task1a" that you can run in this way:
\verbatim
% ./task1a materials.mac
\endverbatim

Notice that the program will exit with an error code if exercise 1a.1 is not correctly completed.

\subsection  t1as3asub1 Exercise 1a.1 : Create a material starting from elements
To create a material from constituent elements you need first to define elements that will build the material.

See in DetectorConstruction::DefineMaterials() how oxygen is created. Add the other needed elements: 
Lead (Pb, Z=82, a=207.20 g/mole) and Tungsten (W, Z=74, a=183.84 g/mole).

You can now create PbWO4 and add the elements in the correct number respecting the material chemical formula. The 
density of PbWO4 is 8.280 g/cm<sup>3</sup>;

To add an element to a material use G4Material::AddElement( G4Element*, G4int numAtoms) method.
For example to add one atom of Pb:
\verbatim
    pbwo4 = new G4Material("PbWO4",//name
                           density,//density
                           3);//number of elements
    pbwo4->AddElement(elPb,1);
\endverbatim

compile and run the application.

- What are the defined materials?
- Check that PbWO4 is created with the correct recipe.

\subsection  t1as3asub2 Exercise 1a.2 : Create the same material with NIST manager

Now we use the NIST manager and use the same material defined in NIST.

Now change the instance of pbwo4. Modify it to use the NIST manager. You should copy from another 
pre-defined material (for example from the tracker materials).

\verbatim
    pbwo4 = .....
\endverbatim

Hint: The NIST lead tungstate material is called: G4_PbWO4

Recompile and run the application.

- What is the difference with the material defined in previous example?

\subsection t1as3asub2bis Exercise 1a.3 : Create a material starting from isotopes

In Geant4 it is possible to define an element with an isotopic composition different 
from the natural one. 

In this exercise define the following G4Isotopes (stable isotopes of germanium) in  DetectorConstruction::DefineMaterials(). 
Then define a G4Element, which is germanium enriched in Ge-76. 
To build up an element starting from G4Isotope pointers, you may use the method 
G4Element::AddIsotope()

\verbatim
Ge-72: Z=32, A=72, atomic mass=71.92 g/mole, isotopic abundance = 0.1%
Ge-73: Z=32, A=73, atomic mass=73.0  g/mole, isotopic abundance = 0.2%
Ge-74: Z=32, A=74, atomic mass=74.0  g/mole, isotopic abundance = 13.1%
Ge-76: Z=32, A=76, atomic mass=76.0  g/mole, isotopic abundance = 86.6%
\endverbatim

Finally, define a G4Material, as metallic germaniumm with density=5.35 g/cm3. 
This material is used for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments.

The G4Material defined here will <b>not</b> be used in the following, is created
just to show how to build an element from isotopes.


\section t1as4 SOLUTION

\subsection t1as4sub1 Exercise 1a.1 : Create a material starting from elements
Here it is:
First build the missing elements
\verbatim
   a=183.84*g/mole;
   G4Element* elW = new G4Element("Tungsten","W",74,a);
   
   a=207.20*g/mole;
   G4Element* elPb = new G4Element("Lead","Pb",82,a);                                
\endverbatim
and then the material
\verbatim
    G4double density = 8.280*g/cm3;
    pbwo4 = new G4Material("PbWO4",//name
                           density,//density
                           3);//number of elements
    pbwo4->AddElement(elPb,1);
    pbwo4->AddElement(elW,1);
    pbwo4->AddElement(elO,4);
\endverbatim

\subsection  t1as4asub2 Exercise 1a.2 : Create the same material with NIST manager
\verbatim
pbwo4 = man->FindOrBuildMaterial("G4_PbWO4");
\endverbatim


\subsection t1as4sub3 Exercise 1a.3 : Create a material starting from isotopes

Edit the method DetectorConstruction::DefineMaterials() as
\verbatim
  G4String name,symbol;
  G4double abundance,density;
  G4int nIsotopes,natoms;
   
  //Define isotopes
  G4Isotope* Ge72 = new G4Isotope(name="Ge72",  32, 72, 71.92*g/mole);
  G4Isotope* Ge73 = new G4Isotope(name="Ge73",  32, 73, 73.0*g/mole);
  G4Isotope* Ge74 = new G4Isotope(name="Ge74",  32, 74, 74.0*g/mole);
  G4Isotope* Ge76 = new G4Isotope(name="Ge76",  32, 76, 76.0*g/mole);
   
  //Define element from isotopes
  G4Element* elGeEnr = new G4Element(name="enrichedGermanium",
                                     symbol="GeEnr",nIsotopes=4);
  elGeEnr->AddIsotope(Ge72,abundance= 0.1*perCent);
  elGeEnr->AddIsotope(Ge73,abundance= 0.2*perCent);
  elGeEnr->AddIsotope(Ge74,abundance= 13.1*perCent);
  elGeEnr->AddIsotope(Ge76,abundance= 86.6*perCent);
   
  //Define material
  G4Material* enrGe = new G4Material(name="EnrichedGe", 
     density=5.35*g/cm3,1);
  enrGe->AddElement(elGeEnr,natoms=1);
